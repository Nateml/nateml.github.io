      <description>Oral creatine supplementation improves brain performance Study shows significantly improved performance in cognitive tests (Raven&amp;rsquo;s Advanced Program Matrices (RAPM) and Wechsler Auditory backward digit span (BDS)) after 6 week periods of creatine supplementation ($5\ g.d^{-1}$)
Note that the subjects were vegetarian or vegan and thus likely had lower natural levels of creatine to begin with, making the effects of creatine potentially more drastic than if the subjects were red meat eaters.</description>
